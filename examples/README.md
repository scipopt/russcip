# russcip Examples

This directory contains examples of how to use the `russcip` library.

## Examples
1. [Simple model](create_and_solve.rs): A simple example of how to create and solve a model, and query the result.
2. [Knapsack solver](knapsack.rs): A simple integer programming model for the knapsack problem.
3. [Cutting stock](cutting_stock.rs): An example price-and-branch algorithm for the cutting stock problem.
4. [Traveling salesman](tsp.rs): An example of how to solve the traveling salesman problem using a branch-and-cut algorithm using a custom constraint handler.
5. [Random rounding](random_rounding.rs): An example demonstrating how to include a primal heuristic that does random rounding to the current LP solution.
6. [Clique separator](clique_separator.rs): An example demonstrating how to implement a clique separator for set partitioning problems.
7. [Most infeasible branching](most_infeasible_branching.rs): An example showing how to implement a custom branching rule that selects variables based on their fractionality.
8. [Node event handler](node_event_handler.rs): An example demonstrating how to track and report information about nodes during the branch-and-bound process.
